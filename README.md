Isometric Tactical Shooter with Time Dilation Mechanics

An isometric shooting game for my intermediate programming class final project, showcasing advanced programming skills and creative design principles.
This game features primitive graphics integrated with animated sprites to enhance visual appeal and gameplay dynamics. A unique temporal time mechanic is employed, 
allowing time to slow down when the player aims, adding a strategic layer to the combat system. This feature not only improves the gameâ€™s tactical depth but also highlights
complex real-time interaction capabilities within game development. The project received high accolades for its innovative approach and technical execution, demonstrating
proficiency in game design and development using modern programming techniques.

Key Features:

Isometric Gameplay: Crafted an engaging 3D isometric view shooter game, providing a unique visual perspective and gameplay experience.

Graphics & Animation: Implemented with primitive yet visually appealing graphics coupled with fluid animated sprites, optimizing both performance and aesthetic appeal.

Temporal Mechanics: Integrated a novel temporal mechanic that slows down time during aiming sequences, enhancing the strategic gameplay elements and player immersion.

High Performance: Received high marks for efficient coding, innovative design, and smooth performance, reflecting strong analytical and development skills.

This project exemplifies my ability to combine creative game design with sophisticated programming skills to create an immersive and technically robust gaming experience.
